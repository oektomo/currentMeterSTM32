- [x] Enable the ADC free running  
- [x] Trying single conversion
- [ ] When using DMA don't forget to make a circular buffer and check if the circular buffer ever overflow
- [ ] tidying the ADC free running code 
- [ ] Enable the Timer to trigger the ADC  
- [ ] do ADC scan conversion mode  
- [ ] update the platform_config.h
